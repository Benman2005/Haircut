## Did you get a haircut

A simple frontend app that checks if the user had a haircut and replies with a suiting response including a small API call to generate a GIF from Giphy. 
I was mostly toying with some CSS features I never tried before. 

Yarn start to initiate app should do it. This project is still under construction, even the api call to Giphy is made using a general development key.

###To do: 
- add features with camera.
- add sparkles
- use three.js for amazing effects.
- deploy with own production key.
