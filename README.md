## Did you get a haircut?

A simple frontend app created with React that checks if the user had a haircut and replies with a suiting response including a small API call to generate a GIF from Giphy. 
Mostly toying with some CSS features I never tried before. 

Yarn start to initiate app should do it. This project is still under construction, but you can see a live example at https://makethecut.netlify.com.

### To do: 
- add features with camera.
- add sparkles
- use three.js for amazing effects.
